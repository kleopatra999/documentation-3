=======================
Development Environment
=======================

Please follow the steps on this page to set up your development environment.

Basic Tools
===========

To be able to develop with ownCloud and also run unit tests, you will need to install `Node.js <https://nodejs.org>`_.

Other required tools will be automatically installed by composer.

Get The Source
==============

There are two ways to obtain ownCloud sources: 

* Using the `stable version <https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.0/admin_manual/#installation>`_
.. TODO ON RELEASE: Update version number above on release
* Using the development version from `GitHub`_ which will be explained below.

To check out the source from `GitHub`_ you will need to install git (see `Setting up git <https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>`_ from the GitHub help)

Gather Information About Server Setup
-------------------------------------

To get started the basic git repositories need to cloned into the Web server's directory. Depending on the distribution this will either be

* **/var/www**
* **/var/www/html** 
* **/srv/http** 


Then identify the user and group the Web server is running as and the Apache user and group for the **chown** command will either be

* **http**
* **www-data** 
* **apache**
* **wwwrun**

Check Out The Code
------------------

The following commands are using **/var/www** as the Web server's directory and **www-data** as user name and group.

Make the directory writable::

  sudo chmod o+rw /var/www
  
Then install ownCloud from git::

  git clone https://github.com/owncloud/core.git

Run make to pull in dependencies::

  cd /var/www/core
  make

where <folder> is the folder where you want to install ownCloud.

Adjust rights::

  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/core/data/
  sudo chmod o-rw /var/www


Finally restart the Web server (this might vary depending on your distribution)::

  sudo systemctl restart httpd.service

or::

  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

After the clone Open http://localhost/core (or the corresponding URL) in your web browser to set up your instance.

Command-Line Automation
-----------------------

If youâ€™re keen to save as much time and effort as possible then take advantage
of the automation available in the most recent version of ownCloud, via `Make`_. 

Below are the available commands, including the target name and a short
description of what each of them does.

================== ============================================================
Target             Description
================== ============================================================
make               Pulls in both Composer and Bower dependencies
make clean         Cleans up dependencies. This is useful for starting over or 
                   when switching to older branches
make dist          Builds a minimal owncloud-core tarball with only core apps
                   in `build/dist/core`, stripped of unwanted files
make docs          Builds the JavaScript documentation using `JSDoc`_
make test          Runs all of the test targets 
make test-external Runs one of the external storage tests, and is configurable 
                   through make variables
make test-js       Runs the Javascript unit tests, replacing `./autotest-js.sh`
make test-php      Runs the PHPUnit tests with SQLite as the datasource. This 
                   replaces `./autotest.sh sqlite`  and is configurable through 
                   make variables
================== ============================================================

Enabling Debug Mode
-------------------
.. _debugmode:

.. note:: Do not enable this for production! This can create security problems and is only meant for debugging and development!

To disable JavaScript and CSS caching debugging has to be enabled by setting ``debug`` to ``true`` in :file:`core/config/config.php`::

  <?php
  $CONFIG = array (
      'debug' => true,
      ... configuration goes here ...
  );

Set Up Web Server And Database
==============================

First `set up your Web server and database <https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.0/admin_manual/installation/index.html>`_ (**Section**: Manual Installation - Prerequisites).

.. TODO ON RELEASE: Update version number above on release
